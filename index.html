    <h1>Privacy Policy — Plandar</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> 2025-11-30</p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Plandar</strong> ("Application") developed and provided by <strong>rabbitturtle</strong> ("Service Provider") collects, uses, and discloses information. The Application is provided as a freemium mobile application.</p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p><strong>What we do <em>not</em> collect:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Application does <strong>not</strong> collect personally identifiable information (PII) such as name, email address, phone number, postal address, or precise device location.</li>
      <li>The Application does <strong>not</strong> require or request user registration, sign-in, or email address collection.</li>
      <li>The Application does <strong>not</strong> track pages visited or time spent in the app for analytics purposes.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>What may be processed automatically:</strong></p>
    <p>Some non-identifiable technical information may be processed automatically by the operating system or by services used by the device (for example, crash reports handled by Google Play services). The Application itself does not collect, store, or transmit identifiable user data.</p>

    <h2>Subscription and Purchase Information</h2>
    <p>The Application uses <strong>Google Play Billing</strong> to process in-app purchases and subscriptions. Purchase transactions and payment details are processed by Google Play and are not accessible to the Service Provider. The Service Provider may receive limited information about subscription status (for example: active or inactive) necessary to provide premium features.</p>
    <p>If the Application uses <strong>RevenueCat</strong> or a similar subscription-management service, purchase-related data may be processed by that service. Please refer to the third party's privacy policy for details.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The Application may use or integrate with third-party services. These services have their own privacy policies and terms. The following third-party services are used (if applicable):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Google Play Services</li>
      <li>Google Play Billing</li>
      <li>RevenueCat (if used)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Links to third-party privacy policies should be consulted for specifics on how those services handle data.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>The Service Provider will not sell or rent personal information. The Service Provider may disclose aggregated or non-identifiable technical information to improve the Application. The Service Provider may also disclose information when required by law or to protect rights, safety, or investigate fraud, or when cooperating with trusted service providers who process data on behalf of the Service Provider.</p>

    <h2>Opt-Out and Data Removal</h2>
    <p>You can stop all data processing related to the Application by uninstalling it from your device using the standard uninstall process. If you have questions about data held by third-party services (for example RevenueCat), please consult that service's privacy policy and support channels for removal requests.</p>

    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>The Application is not directed to children under 13 years of age, and the Service Provider does not knowingly collect information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>The Service Provider takes reasonable steps to protect information by using standard administrative, technical, and physical safeguards. However, no method of transmission or electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. The updated policy will be posted on this page with the effective date. Continued use of the Application after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact the Service Provider at <a href="mailto:rabbitturtle.sup@gmail.com">rabbitturtle.sup@gmail.com</a>.</p>
